# linkedin-scripts
Browser console scripts to help with lead generation on LinkedIn. Use responsibly!

# About the library

LinkedIn is an amazing resource for keeping track of your network, but for developers it can be really hard to use its bubbly UI efficiently when we are used to simple and elegant interfaces.

These scripts are intended to LinkedIn a little bit less "Facebook" and a bit more "spreadsheet".

# Responsible use

Please note, these scripts are for personal use only, and should not be used for any automation such as mass adding or messaging.

We will unfortunately not be able to answer any questions or support requests for activity that is against LinkedIn Terms and Conditions.

# Contribution

PRs and issues are actively encouraged, especially if you find that a script has stopped working! ðŸ›
